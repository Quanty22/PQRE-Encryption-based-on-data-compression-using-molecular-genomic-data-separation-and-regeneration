Our demo of Basic Guardium showcases cutting-edge features tailored for personal use only. This innovative software integrates post-quantum encryption and a unique data compression technique to ensure top-notch security and efficiency.

It's worth noting that Basic Guardium is open-source, allowing users to freely utilize and modify it according to their preferences. However, due to our ecosystem's security measures, each individual is granted a unique ID number, preventing distribution to others.

Basic Version: Designed for swift and secure encryption and compression of personal data. Already 2.3 times faster than current encryption methods, this version comes equipped with a built-in data compressor for enhanced efficiency.

Master Version: Similar to the Basic Version but with 1.5 times faster encryption and compression speeds. Additionally, it offers the option to add multiple users, making it ideal for ensuring online safety for the whole family.

Pro Version: Boasting 3.5 times faster encryption and 2.5 times faster compression compared to standard methods, the Pro Version provides advanced security features. Like the Master Version, it also allows the addition of multiple users, making it perfect for safeguarding the online activities of your entire family.
